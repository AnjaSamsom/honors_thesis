No but seeing women instructors helped
No
No
No I don't think so. I knew before going into computer science that there was a limited amount of women in the field so I was not surprised that I had a majority male teachers/professors.
No
Not particularly
No
Not with my first class but later on with the harder classes having a female role model definitely made more confident in my choice to continue cs 
No
No. I was stuck with comp sci so the gender of the teacher didn't  make an impact on my decision.

"No, I think I just liked computer science. I honestly forgot about the experience till I thought about it for this."
"No I don't think so. Although my best friend identified as male, I think that him being my best friend played more of a role than his gender. I think I would’ve had the same amazement in 7th grade if my best friend was female or nonbinary."
No
Not particularly but he also put a lot of emphasis on making sure everyone felt included and capable regardless of gender.
"I am not sure. I was introduced in 3rd grade, and it was not a well known thing in my community "
"No, but I think a female instructor would have urged me to continue more courses. "

"I don't  think so; I was really interested in the material at the time, and would have stopped at nothing to learn how to make the kinds of things I wanted to make. However, there is a good chance that the fact that my earliest teachers were also men influenced my sensation that I belonged in that particular path. I did have a female computer science teacher in high school however who I also greatly admired, and helped influence my decision to continue to study computer science."

"I don't  think they did. When taking my first computer science class (Intro to Programming) at UVM, I took it online. I had little to no interaction with my professor. I heard his voice in the videos and exchanged some emails with him, but his gender was not something I paid attention to. This class was also what really sparked my interest and made me decide to change my major to computer science.  "

"maybe, although he was a man, i immediately noticed that he was intentionally inclusive and used feminine pronouns in his hypothetical examples like “if a programmer wants x and SHE does y….” or “if your boss asks for x and you tell HER…” which i found to be very sweet and encouraging "
