The Impact of Female Role Models on the Retention of Women in Computer Science

Principal Investigator (PI):

Anja Samsom (student), Lisa Dion (advisor)


Department:

UVM Honors College and CEMS Computer Science (CS)

Introduction:
You are being invited to take part in this research study because you have some level of experience with computer science. This study is being conducted by Anja Samsom for her Honors College thesis at the University of Vermont.


Purpose:
The purpose of this study is to gain information about the impact of female role models on the retention of women in computer science. Not being a woman or not currently being in a computer science field does not disqualify you from participating in the study.


Study Procedures:

If you take part in the study, you will be asked to complete a survey. This survey will take about 5 – 10 minutes and will ask you about your introduction to computer science, the gender of whoever introduced you to computer science, your gender, and the amount that you continued with computer science, among other questions.


Benefits:

As a participant in this research study, there may not be direct benefit for you; however, information from this study may benefit other people now or in the future.


Risks:

We will not collect any information that will identify you in order to protect your confidentiality.


Costs:

There will be no costs to you for participation in this research study, other than your time.


Compensation:

You will not be paid for taking part in this study. After the survey, you will be directed to a separate link with the option to enter a drawing to win one of four $100 digital Visa gift cards. To enter the gift card drawing after the survey, you will be directed to a separate form that asks for only your email. Your gift card drawing information will not be able to be linked to your survey submission.


Confidentiality:

All information collected about you during the course of this study will be stored without any identifiers. No one will be able to match you to your answers. There are text fields in this survey. Please do not input any confidential information in this survey.
Voluntary:

Participation/Withdrawal Taking part in this study is voluntary. You may choose not to take part in this study.
